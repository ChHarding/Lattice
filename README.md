# Lattice - make lattice dogbones

- Lattice is made from crossing "strands" (symetrical)
- Lattic is defined by a radius r, a gap g along x between strands and angle a in which the strands are rotated positive and negative around y.
- Lattice will clipped and be placed at the center of a D363 Type 1 dogbone
- The central part that it is clipped with is  13 mm in x, 3.2 mm in y and 57 mm in z  
- The radius can be varied but will be scaled to be exactly 1.6 mm along the y-axis (i.e. the cylinder is based on an ellipsis, not a circle). This is done so it can be 3D printed w/o support.   

This shows the pre-clip setup for a r1.6 mm, g8 mm a45 deg lattice:

- before clipping 2 cylinders are posted left and right (will be clipped in half) to provide a frame. 2 cylinder with 1.6 mm radius will be added on top and bottom to connect to the non-central D363 parts
